# azure-devops-symbols

This repository contains tools and utilities for JavaScript projects to produce
SourceMap files that can be uploaded to Azure DevOps Symbol server using the
`PublishSymbols` task.

You configure your javascript build to 'stamp' or 'index' the .js files with a URL to the sourcemap from the azure devops symbol server and update the .js.map files to contain the unique client key of the symbol server url.

## 1. Stamping the sourcemaps
### Option 1: WebPack
If your project uses webpack, configuring this is pretty easy.
Add the following to your `webpack.config.js` file:
```js
const { AzureDevOpsSymbolsPlugin } = require('azure-devops-symbols-webpack-plugin');

...

module.exports = {
    ...
    plugins: [
        ...

        new AzureDevOpsSymbolsPlugin({
            organization: "contoso"
        })
    ],
    ...
};
```
You have to configure the name of the organization to match. In the example above your azure devops url would be: `https://dev.azure.com/contoso`

After this you can upload the symbols to the backend by adding the following yaml to your azure devops pipeline:
```yml
- task: PublishSymbols@2
  displayName: Publish symbols
  inputs:
    SearchPattern: "**/dist/*.js.map"
    SymbolServerType: TeamServices
```

### Option 2: Script
If you don't use webpack you can add an extra step in your pipeline by using the cli tool:

```yml
- script: |
    npx azure-devops-symbols-sourcemap-cli --organization contoso
  displayName: Stamp js sourcemaps
```
You have to configure the name of the organization to match. In the example above your azure devops url would be: `https://dev.azure.com/contoso`

## Upload symbols
You can use the standard [PublishSymbols](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/artifacts/symbols?view=azure-devops) task to upload symbols.

> Note: This part is not yet implemented and we are working with the Azure DevOps team to get this incorporated

```yml
- task: PublishSymbols@2
  displayName: Publish symbols
  inputs:
    SearchPattern: "**/dist/*.js.map"
    SymbolServerType: TeamServices
```
